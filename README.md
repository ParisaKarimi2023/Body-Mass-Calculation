# Body Mass Calculation (BMI)
##  Introduction

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used method to evaluate whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height. 
Developers often implement BMI calculators in websites, mobile applications, or health-monitoring systems.
JavaScript is commonly used for this task due to its simplicity and ability to run directly in the browser.
