# Body Mass Calculation (BMI)
##  Introduction

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used method to evaluate whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height. 
Developers often implement BMI calculators in websites, mobile applications, or health-monitoring systems.
JavaScript is commonly used for this task due to its simplicity and ability to run directly in the browser.
##  What is BMI?

Example:
Weight = 60 kg
Height = 1.65 m
BMI = 60 / (1.65 × 1.65) = 22.03
